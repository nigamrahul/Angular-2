For Running this project we need to do some thing - 

1. We need to install json server by using 'npm install -g json server' in command prompt.
2. After that, we need to create one dummy json file in our system at any place. its not rrquired to take within our project folder only..you
can take it at any where.
3. Now go to command prompt & reach the the json file path in command prompt like - F:\JSON\
4. After that now type : json-server -p 4455(any port no as your wish) product.json(your json file name with extension)then hit enter
You will see one path like http://localhost:4455/products
